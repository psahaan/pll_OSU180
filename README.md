 ## About the Workshop 
This course will be an in-depth introduction to On-Chip Clock Multiplier (PLL) design and layout using open-source EDA tools (ngspice & Magic) on OSU180nm. This course starts with fundamentals (from CMOS inverter & basic semiconductor physics) to Advanced IP design Process, issues & ways to deal with them (by live demo of entire IP from Design to Layout).
